railboard-dark-theme
====================

SublimeText/TextMate theme for front-end dev. A hybrid of Blackboard and Railscast2 color scheme/themes.

I liked the look of HTML & JS in Blackboard (included with SB2) but I liked the color scheme of the CSS and SCSS in Railscast2.tmTheme:

So I combined them. Dark blue background, vivid but not overly bright text.
